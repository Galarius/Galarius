### Hi there, I'm Ilia! 👋 

## 🛠️ My Spectrum of Interests

From system programming to user interface development, my interests span across the entire development process. I leverage the unique capabilities of the Apple ecosystem, including macOS, iOS, and watchOS, to craft efficient and intuitive applications.

## 🚀 My Open-Source Endeavours

While my professional life revolves mostly around macOS development, I find joy in the contrast of open-source contributions. It's a wonderful distraction that allows me to grow and improve in different, yet closely related areas of programming. I'm the creator and chief maintainer of the [vscode-opencl](https://github.com/galarius/vscode-opencl) extension and [opencl-language-server](https://github.com/galarius/opencl-language-server), tools designed to make OpenCL programming more approachable for beginners.
