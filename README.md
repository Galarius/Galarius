### Hi there!👋 I'm Ilia! 

## 🛠️ My Spectrum of Interests

From system programming to user interface development, my interests span across the entire development process. I leverage the unique capabilities of the Apple ecosystem, including macOS, iOS, and watchOS, to craft efficient and intuitive applications.

## 🚀 My Open-Source Endeavours [![ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/img/githubbutton_sm.svg)](https://ko-fi.com/V7V4NLG1M)

While my professional life revolves mostly around macOS development, I find joy in the contrast of open-source contributions. It's a wonderful distraction that allows me to grow and improve in different, yet closely related areas of programming. I'm the creator and chief maintainer of the [vscode-opencl](https://github.com/yourusername/vscode-openc) extension and [opencl-language-server](https://github.com/Galarius/opencl-language-server), tools designed to make OpenCL programming more approachable for beginners.
